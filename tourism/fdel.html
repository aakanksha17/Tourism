being the perfect start to a &#8220;healthy&#8221; morning in most Delhi
households, to a meal for hungry college students and even a late-night
snack, paranthas are definitely on the top of the list when it comes to
my favorite food in Delhi. Choose from a plain one or select a stuffing
of your choice - potatoes, cauliflower, radish, eggs, keema, bananas or
even last night&#8217;s left over dal - the options are galore.<br>Where can
I try this dish? Paranthe Wali Gali in Chandni Chowk, whose past

there is one thing that keeps the Delhi food scene ticking it&#8217;s the
Street Food. With a variety that is unmatched, eating on the streets of
Delhi is a crash course in the history and culture of the place.
Chandni Chowk is undoubtedly the Street Food Capital of Delhi, and
while no guide book can actually pinpoint the best places for Chaat,
there are some landmark food haunts that really stand out. Of course,
if you aren&#8217;t willing to travel that far, fret not for there are plenty
of options for street food in Delhi.<br>Where can I try the dish? UPSC

an interesting story about the origin of one of the most gratifying
dishes on this planet. It originated in the 1950s in Moti Mahal
Restaurant, Daryaganj, a neighbourhood skirting the Walled City. Known
for its Tandoori Chicken, the cooks there accidentally tossed the sauce
consisting of butter, tomato and chicken juices with tandoori chicken
pieces; the rest is history. Today, this dish can be found in almost
every non-vegetarian restaurant and highway dhabas and is best enjoyed
with rice or naan.<br>Where can I try this dish? Moti Mahal, Daryaganj; Havemore, Pandara Road.<br><img style="width: 225px; height: 136px;" alt="" src="bc.jpg"><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kebabs</span><br>Whoever
thought grilled chunks of meat or fish marinated in aromatic Indian
spices couldn&#8217;t give you joy should think again. While we Delhiites
have a lot to be thankful for to the Mughals, Kebabs are one of them.
Whether it is Kebabs being delivered to your car, a quintessentially
Delhi experience, to food stalls and fine dining restaurants across the
city, try this popular dish and you will be hooked forever.<br>Where

a piece of advice: This dish is best enjoyed on an empty stomach. Rich,
spicy and heavy, this is one of the most popular Punjabi dishes and is
definitely on my list of top 10 must-try dishes in Delhi. Don&#8217;t be
surprised if you find it on the breakfast menu of restaurants across
the capital. You can find this lip smacking dish at all food joints, be

favourite of the Mughal Emperors, the Biryani has stood the test of
time and is today enjoyed all over India. This poultry or meat based
dish is prepared in an earthen pot and the lid is sealed with dough so

dhabas, to the Sufi shrines and five-star hotels.<br>Where can I try this dish?

you enter Old Delhi and walk into the serpentine lanes, you can&#8217;t help
but be drawn to the aroma of one of the region&#8217;s signature delicacies,
the Nihari. This rich, spicy broth of slow cooked meat is served
alongside hot tandoori rotis or preferably khameeri rotis. The dish was
a favourite within the royal families, who used to feast on it in the
mornings. Today it serves as the ideal nourishment for labourers,
rickshaw pullers, coolies and many others looking to kick start their
day.<br>Where can I try this dish? Bara Hindu Rao area; Karim&#8217;s near Jama Masjid.<br><img style="width: 225px; height: 136px;" alt="" src="nihri.jpg"><br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rolls </span><br>Ok,
so we aren&#8217;t going to take the credit away from Kolkata, where the
original Kathi roll recipe was developed, but Delhi has its own
delicious variants. From street stalls offering a variety of rolls, to
