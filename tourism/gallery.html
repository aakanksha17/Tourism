throws out to the south of the magnificent mountain ranges that stretch
in a sword like curve across the southern border of Tibet. Shaped like
an irregular quadrilateral, this large expanse of territory we call
India, deserves the name of a subcontinent. Ancient Geographers
referred to India as being "constituted with a four-fold conformation"
(chatuh samasthana samsthitam), "on its South and West and East is the
Great Ocean, the Himavat range stretches along its north like the
string of a bow".</span><span style="color: white;"> </span><br><br style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Metropolitian Cities of India</span><br><a style="color: rgb(0, 0, 154);" href="imum.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold;">MUMBAI</span></a> <span style="color: yellow;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">&nbsp;<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Lucida Sans;">(also
