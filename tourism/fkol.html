early 2013, the dwindling Jewish community of Kolkata, and many
non-Jewish Kolkatans, mourned the passing of David Elias Nahoum, the
long-time owner of Nahoum and Sons confectionary shop. A long-standing
Kolkata icon, the bakery was first established by Nahoum Israel in
1902, an Iraqi-Jew who immigrated from Baghdad. In the early half of
the century, anywhere between 3,000 to 5,000 Jewish people sought
refuge in this bustling city where they set up their own schools,
synagogues and newspapers and brought with them traditional Jewish
foods. Now, only a handful of Jewish people &#8212; an estimated 25 &#8212; remain.
Yet their influence is still evident in the city&#8217;s few Jewish bakeries,
none more beloved than Nahoum and Sons confectionary. The Jewish baking
tradition is carried on by Isaac, the brother of David Nahoum Visitors
to the city&#8217;s New Market area can find stacks of brownies and rum balls
as well a rich selection of cakes, biscuits, pastries and breads fresh
from the oven.<br>Address: New Market, Bertram St, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.<br><img style="width: 225px; height: 149px;" alt="" src="nahoum.jpg"><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flurys | English Tearoom and Breakfast</span><br>Flurys
